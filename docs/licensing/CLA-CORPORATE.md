# TAURUS AI CORP.
## CORPORATE CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT

**Version 1.0 - Effective Date: December 4, 2025**

---

Thank you for your organization's interest in contributing to TAURUS AI Corp. ("TAURUS AI", "we", "us", or "our"). This Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by corporations and other legal entities to TAURUS AI for Contributions made by their employees, contractors, and authorized representatives.

## Why This Agreement Is Needed

TAURUS AI operates under a **Triple-Plus Licensing Model** (MIT + FSL + BSL + Commercial + OEM/White-Label) that allows us to:

1. Provide open-source software to the community under permissive licenses (MIT)
2. Offer functional source licenses (FSL) with business limitations
3. Provide business source licenses (BSL) with usage restrictions
4. Enable commercial licensing for enterprises requiring proprietary deployment rights
5. Support OEM and white-label partnerships for revenue generation

To maintain this flexibility and ensure we can dual-license contributions appropriately, we need corporate contributors to grant us sufficient rights to contributions made by their employees and authorized representatives. This Agreement protects both your organization and TAURUS AI by clarifying the intellectual property rights in contributions made on behalf of your organization.

## Agreement Terms

This is a legally binding agreement between the organization identified below ("Corporation" or "You") and TAURUS AI. By signing this Agreement, the Corporation accepts and agrees to the following terms and conditions for Contributions it has submitted or will submit to TAURUS AI.

---

## SECTION 1: DEFINITIONS

**1.1** "Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally Submitted by the Corporation or its employees, contractors, or authorized representatives to TAURUS AI for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products, projects, or repositories owned or managed by TAURUS AI (the "Work").

**1.2** "Submit" or "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to TAURUS AI or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), issue tracking systems, pull requests, code reviews, and any other communication channels managed by or on behalf of TAURUS AI.

**1.3** "Authorized Contributors" means employees, contractors, or other representatives of the Corporation who are authorized by the Corporation to Submit Contributions on its behalf and who are listed on Schedule A attached to this Agreement, as may be amended from time to time.

**1.4** "Control" means:

- (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise; or
- (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares; or
- (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

**1.5** "Affiliate" means any entity that Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with the Corporation.

## APPENDIX B: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS FOR CORPORATE CONTRIBUTORS

**Q1: Why does our company need to sign a Corporate CLA?**

A: If your employees, contractors, or representatives contribute to TAURUS AI projects as part of their work for your company, their Contributions are owned by your company (not by them individually). The Corporate CLA grants TAURUS AI the necessary rights to use those Contributions in our Triple-Plus Licensing Model. Individual CLAs only cover contributions made by individuals in their personal capacity, not on behalf of employers.

**Q2: Does our company retain ownership of our Contributions?**

A: Yes! Your company retains full copyright ownership. The Corporate CLA grants TAURUS AI a license to use your Contributions, but your company keeps the copyright and can use the code in your own products, license it to others, or contribute it to other projects.

**Q3: Can we use our Contributions in our own commercial products?**

A: Absolutely. Your company retains full rights to use your Contributions in any way, including in your own commercial products, whether related to TAURUS AI projects or not.

**Q4: What if we want to prevent TAURUS AI from using our Contributions commercially?**

A: The Corporate CLA specifically grants TAURUS AI the right to use Contributions in commercial versions. If you're not comfortable with this, you may want to use TAURUS AI products under their open-source licenses rather than contributing code. Alternatively, we can discuss strategic partnership agreements with different terms.

**Q5: Can our employees contribute to TAURUS AI projects in their personal capacity?**

A: That depends on your employment agreements. If your employment agreements assign all IP created by employees to your company (even outside work hours), then all their Contributions belong to the company and should be covered by the Corporate CLA. If your employees own their personal projects, they can sign Individual CLAs for personal Contributions, but contributions made during work hours or using company resources typically belong to the company.

**Q6: How do we manage the list of Authorized Contributors?**

A: You can add or remove Authorized Contributors at any time by sending an updated Schedule A to legal@taurusai.io. Changes take effect immediately upon our acknowledgment. We also support automated synchronization for large organizations.

**Q7: What happens if an employee leaves our company?**

A: Simply send us an updated Schedule A removing that employee. The license grants for Contributions they made while employed remain in effect (since those Contributions were owned by your company), but they can no longer make new Contributions on your company's behalf. If they want to continue contributing personally, they should sign an Individual CLA.

**Q8: Do we need to sign separate CLAs for each TAURUS AI project or repository?**

A: No. This Corporate CLA covers all Contributions to any TAURUS AI project, repository, or product, both current and future.

**Q9: Can we withdraw or revoke our Contributions after they're merged?**

A: No. The license grant is irrevocable, meaning once Contributions are submitted and merged, they cannot be withdrawn. This protects TAURUS AI and other users who may rely on your Contributions. However, you can stop making new Contributions at any time by terminating this Agreement.

**Q10: What if our company is acquired or merges with another company?**

A: The acquiring or merged entity can assume this Agreement with TAURUS AI's written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Alternatively, the new entity can sign a new Corporate CLA. In either case, the license grants for Contributions made prior to the transaction remain in effect.

**Q11: Does this CLA cover our Affiliates and subsidiaries?**

A: Yes, if you list them on Schedule B. The CLA can cover your entire corporate family, making it easier to manage Contributions from multiple related entities under one agreement.

**Q12: What if we contribute code that contains patents we own?**

A: The patent license grant in Section 3 grants TAURUS AI and users of TAURUS AI products a license to any patents necessarily infringed by your Contributions. This is standard in open-source CLAs and ensures that contributing patented code doesn't create patent infringement risks for TAURUS AI or users. You retain your patents and can license them to others; you're simply granting TAURUS AI and TAURUS AI product users a license for patents covering your Contributions.

**Q13: Can we negotiate different terms?**

A: For strategic partnerships, major contributions, or unique circumstances, we're open to discussing customized agreements. Contact legal@taurusai.io to discuss your specific needs. However, for most corporate contributors, the standard Corporate CLA provides a fair balance of rights.

**Q14: How do we know TAURUS AI will honor the open-source licenses?**

A: TAURUS AI has a public commitment to maintaining open-source versions of our products. Our business model depends on maintaining trust with both the open-source community and commercial customers. Commercial licenses fund development that benefits everyone. Additionally, once code is released under an open-source license like MIT, that release is irrevocable.

**Q15: What if we want to contribute to TAURUS AI but keep some enhancements private?**

A: You're only required to contribute back changes if you distribute modified versions under copyleft licenses. For TAURUS AI's MIT/FSL/BSL licensed projects, you can make private modifications without contributing them back. However, contributing your enhancements back benefits you by ensuring compatibility with future versions and reducing your maintenance burden.

**Q16: Does signing this CLA give us any special access or benefits?**

A: The CLA itself is about legal rights to Contributions. However, active corporate contributors may be eligible for:
- Recognition on our website and in project documentation (optional, with your permission)
- Invitation to contributor advisory board for major projects (if established)
- Early notice of major architectural changes affecting your Contributions
- Optional commercial support agreements at preferred rates

**Q17: How long does it take to get the CLA approved?**
