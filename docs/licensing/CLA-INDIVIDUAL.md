# TAURUS AI CORP.
## INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT

**Version 1.0 - Effective Date: December 4, 2025**

---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TAURUS AI Corp. ("TAURUS AI", "we", "us", or "our"). This Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to TAURUS AI.

## Why This Agreement Is Needed

TAURUS AI operates under a **Triple-Plus Licensing Model** (MIT + FSL + BSL + Commercial + OEM/White-Label) that allows us to:

1. Provide open-source software to the community under permissive licenses (MIT)
2. Offer functional source licenses (FSL) with business limitations
3. Provide business source licenses (BSL) with usage restrictions
4. Enable commercial licensing for enterprises requiring proprietary deployment rights
5. Support OEM and white-label partnerships for revenue generation

To maintain this flexibility and ensure we can dual-license contributions appropriately, we need contributors to grant us sufficient rights to your contributions. This Agreement protects both you and TAURUS AI by clarifying the intellectual property rights in your contributions.

## Agreement Terms

This is a legally binding agreement between you (either an individual or a single legal entity, "You" or "Your") and TAURUS AI. By signing this Agreement, You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to TAURUS AI.

---

### 1. DEFINITIONS

**1.1** "Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to TAURUS AI for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products, projects, or repositories owned or managed by TAURUS AI (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to TAURUS AI or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, TAURUS AI for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work.

**1.2** "Submit" or "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to TAURUS AI or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), issue tracking systems, pull requests, code reviews, and any other communication channels managed by or on behalf of TAURUS AI.

**1.3** "You" or "Your" means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is entering into this Agreement with TAURUS AI. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

**3.2** If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

---

## APPENDIX B: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why does TAURUS AI need a CLA?**

A: The CLA allows us to operate our Triple-Plus Licensing Model, which provides free open-source software to the community while generating revenue through commercial licenses that fund continued development.

**Q: Do I retain copyright to my Contributions?**

A: Yes! You retain full copyright ownership. The CLA grants TAURUS AI a license to use your Contributions, but you keep your copyright and can use your code elsewhere.

**Q: Can I contribute the same code to other projects?**

A: Absolutely. You retain ownership and can license your work to anyone, including other open-source projects.

**Q: What if my employer owns my code?**

A: Your employer needs to sign the Corporate CLA, and you need to be listed as an authorized contributor on their behalf.

**Q: Can TAURUS AI take my code and make it proprietary?**

A: We can include your Contributions in commercial versions, but we maintain parallel open-source versions. Your code remains available to the community under open-source licenses.

**Q: Do I get paid for my Contributions?**

A: This CLA covers voluntary contributions. Paid development requires a separate consulting or employment agreement.

**Q: What if I submit someone else's code?**

A: You must clearly mark it as third-party work and provide full attribution and licensing information. We may reject third-party code that conflicts with our licensing model.

**Q: Can I withdraw my Contributions?**

A: Once submitted and merged, Contributions cannot be withdrawn due to the irrevocable license grant. However, we will honor reasonable requests to be removed from attribution.

**Q: How long is this Agreement valid?**

A: The license grants are perpetual and irrevocable. The Agreement covers all your present and future Contributions to TAURUS AI.

**Q: What happens if TAURUS AI is acquired?**

A: The licenses granted under this CLA would transfer to the acquiring entity. The open-source licenses ensure community access is maintained.
